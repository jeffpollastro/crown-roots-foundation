    <h1>The National College Database</h1>
    <p>Academics is the path. Athletic scholarships are a lottery &mdash; academic aid is obtainable. This tool shows Pocono families the truth about what college actually costs.</p>
</div>

<!-- The Problem -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Problem This Solves</h2>
    <div class="stat-cards" style="margin:0 0 24px; padding:0;">
        <div class="stat-card">
            <div class="number">$45,000</div>
            <div class="label">What families see: "Average Financial Aid"</div>
        </div>
        <div class="stat-card">
            <div class="number" style="color:#dc2626;">$18,000</div>
            <div class="label">What families miss: "You still owe this per year"</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Too many kids on the mountain hear "I'm going to the League" and build their entire future around an athletic scholarship that statistically won't come. Meanwhile, academic aid &mdash; grants, merit scholarships, need-based packages &mdash; is exponentially more obtainable and goes unclaimed every year. The problem isn't a lack of opportunity. It's a lack of information.</p>
    <p>College websites advertise generous aid packages. What they don't make clear is <strong>The Gap</strong> &mdash; the amount families must actually find through savings, work, or debt after all grant aid is applied. For Pocono families earning $30,000-$48,000, this gap can mean the difference between graduating and dropping out. Our database makes The Gap impossible to miss.</p>
</div>

<!-- How It Works -->
<div class="section-alt">
    <div class="section-inner">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>1. Enter Your Income</h3>
                <p>Select your family income bracket. The database instantly filters schools and calculates your estimated gap at each institution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>2. See The Gap First</h3>
                <p>Results are sorted by lowest gap first &mdash; not by prestige, not by sticker price. Schools that actually meet your need rise to the top.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>3. Compare Side-by-Side</h3>
                <p>Compare up to 3 schools with Pocono-specific travel costs included. The "close and cheap" option is often the most expensive.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card" style="grid-column: 1 / -1; max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto;">
                <h3>4. Pocono Travel Costs</h3>
                <p>Every school includes realistic travel estimates from the Poconos &mdash; replacing generic transportation budgets with actual flight and drive costs.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Gap Severity -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Gap Warning System</h2>
    <p>Every school in the database gets a clear severity rating based on what your family would need to find beyond grant aid:</p>
    <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
        <p><span class="severity severity-low"></span> <strong>Low Gap ($0 - $2,500/year)</strong> &mdash; This school is likely affordable for your family.</p>
        <p><span class="severity severity-medium"></span> <strong>Medium Gap ($2,501 - $7,500/year)</strong> &mdash; Budget carefully. You'll need to cover the gap beyond aid.</p>
        <p><span class="severity severity-high"></span> <strong>High Gap ($7,501 - $15,000/year)</strong> &mdash; Significant out-of-pocket cost. Over 4 years, you'd need to find $30,000-$60,000 beyond aid.</p>
        <p><span class="severity severity-critical"></span> <strong>Critical Gap ($15,001+/year)</strong> &mdash; Danger zone. Many students in this situation don't finish their degree.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="definition-box">
        <strong>Key principle:</strong> Loans are debt, not aid. The Gap represents what families must find through savings, work, or borrowing &mdash; we never subtract loans from the calculation.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Sample Comparison -->

    <h2>What the Data Reveals</h2>
    <p>For a family earning $30,000-$48,000, the numbers can be counterintuitive:</p>

    <div class="definition-box">
        The "close and affordable" option can cost $53,900 more over 4 years than a school 3,000 miles away. Our database helps families see this before they commit.
