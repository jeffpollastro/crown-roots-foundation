    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Pocono Mountain has the athletes, the scholars, and the future leaders. What it doesn't have is access &mdash; to development, to mentorship, to the information that shows kids how big the world really is. These numbers illustrate why our youth are isolated and underserved, not just athletically, but academically and socially.</p>
    <p>Crown Roots Foundation exists to change that by funding and supporting <strong>Crown Hub</strong> &mdash; a program that uses basketball as a conduit to reach young people and connect them with academics, mentorship, and expanded worldview.</p>
