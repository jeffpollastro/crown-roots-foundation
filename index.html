    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Pocono Mountain has the athletes. It has the families. It even has newly renovated gymnasiums. What it doesn't have is structured, year-round youth basketball development &mdash; and the gap between Mountain and Valley programs is growing every season.</p>
    <p>Crown Roots Foundation exists to close that gap by funding and supporting <strong>Crown Hub</strong>, a comprehensive youth basketball program that combines athletics with academic support, college readiness, and community investment.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Academic Integration</h3>
